ProspectiveProv is a provenance visualization tool that uses provenance data collected by 
[noWorkflow](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow) to generate a provenance graph based on the prospective provenance, allowing scientists to obtain details about the scientific experiments developed in Python. We expect that prospectiveProv can be helpful to allow developers and scientists to have a better understanding of the programming structure of Python script experiments. 

Using prospectiveProv is simple. For generate provenance graphs using prospectiveProv, the users only need to run a Python script experiment using [noWorkflow](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow) and perform prospectiveProv right away. Currently, this version of prospectiveProv supports [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) and [noWorkflow-2.0 Alpha](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow/tree/2.0-alpha).

## System Requirement
   - [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
   - [noWorkflow-2.0](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow/tree/2.0-alpha)
   - [GraphViz version 2.40.1 or higher](https://www.graphviz.org/)

## Quick Installation

## Basic Usage
To use the ProspectiveProv, you must execute your script Python using noWorkflow. After running your script, in the ".noworkflow" folder, you could call the prospectiveProv as follow: 
```
prospective trial <trial_id> 
```
After that, the prospectiveProv will use the information available in the SQLite database created by noWorkflow to generate a provenance graph based on script structure, displaying calls, functions, conditional sentences, loops, variables, and classes.

To see all functions available in ProspectiveProv, just run the following command:
```
prospective --help 
```
### Inspecting variables

To check the contents of all variables in the provenance graph, just run the command:
```
prospective --trial <id> --var 1 
```
### Showing executed code blocks

ProspectiveProv also allows to display in the provenance graph all lines of code that are activated during the execution of the script, just type:
```
prospective --trial <id> --act 1 
```
